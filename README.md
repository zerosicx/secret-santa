# 🎅 Secret Santa Hat Drawing 🎄

*Shhh... the elves are watching!*

A delightfully modern React + TypeScript app that brings the magic of Secret Santa to your screen. No more crumpled paper slips or suspicious peeking—just pure, digital gift-giving mischief! ✨

## ✨ Features That'll Make Santa Jealous

- 🎩 **Simple Setup**: Pop everyone into the virtual hat with names and optional photos (so you know whose wishlist to raid)
- 🤫 **Top-Secret Drawing**: Each person sneakily reveals their assignment—no peeking allowed!
- 📸 **Photo Support**: Upload photos or URLs because faces are more fun than names
- 📱 **Works Everywhere**: Mobile, tablet, desktop—spread the cheer on any device!
- 💾 **Never Forgets**: Your progress magically saves to localStorage (we're basically elves)
- 🎊 **Confetti Explosions**: Because revealing your Secret Santa deserves a celebration!
- ♿ **Everyone's Invited**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support for maximum inclusivity

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (a.k.a. Santa's Workshop Tools)

- **React 18** - For that smooth, jolly UI
- **TypeScript** - Because even Santa's list needs types
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast builds (faster than Rudolph!)
- **Zustand** - State management that remembers who's naughty and nice
- **Tailwind CSS** - Making it prettier than a snow globe

## 🎮 How to Play (The Secret Santa Games Begin!)

### 🎄 Setup Phase: Building Your Crew

1. Click "Add participant" to toss folks into the virtual hat
2. Enter their name and snap a photo (URL or upload—selfies encouraged!)
3. Add at least 2 participants (it takes two to tango... or Secret Santa)
4. Hit "Ready: Lock & Shuffle" when your squad is complete

### 🎁 Drawing Phase: The Sacred Ritual

1. **Pass the device** to the first brave soul
2. **Everyone else covers their eyes!** (No peeking, you sneaky elves!)
3. They tap a mysterious face-down card to discover their Secret Santa destiny
4. Now they must choose:
   - Click "Hide & Keep" to accept their fate (card vanishes into the void! 💨)
   - Click "Cancel & Pick Again" for a do-over (commitment issues are valid)
5. **Pass the device** to the next person (keep that suspense alive!)
6. Repeat until everyone's drawn—cue the confetti! 🎉
